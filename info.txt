Project Overview:
Create a multi-page website for a Spiritual Director named Barb who offers one-on-one and group-based spiritual direction services. The website should evoke warmth, trust, and peace ‚Äî using a candlelight-inspired color palette and a minimalist, modern layout.

Warm Taupe #F9EFDF

Burnt Sienna (primary) #A55F39

Soft candlelight imagery should be used to create a sense of calm, peace, and introspection.

-- notes about the client: Barb is German and lived in Germany until she married Jeff and moved to the United States.

She love being a mother to her wonderful four children.

In the last two decades, she has been involved in various aspects of church ministry in Germany and the United States. This involvement has drawn her toward a deepening interest in disciplines and practices that promote spiritual encounter and spiritual growth. 

A few years ago, this desire led her to participate in a two-year training in Spiritual Direction and have been blessed to grow in the practice of offering spiritual friendship (direction). Following this, she completed a two-year course of study in Spiritual Formation through the Epiphany Certification Program. 

In ministry and motherhood, her longing for a solid spiritual foundation has drawn her into more deliberate practices of God‚Äôs presence. She has a great desire to cooperate with God as He draws His people into greater freedom and union with Him.
